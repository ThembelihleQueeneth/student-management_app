# 🎓 Student Management App

The **Student Management App** is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application built with **Node.js, Express.js, EJS, and SQLite3**.  
It allows users to manage student records efficiently by adding, editing, viewing, and deleting student information.

This project was created by **Thembelihle** as a learning exercise in full-stack development using Node.js and SQLite3.

## 📖 How the App Works

The Student Management App provides a basic interface for managing students:

1. **Homepage (Student List)**  
   - Displays all students stored in the database.  
   - Shows student **ID, Name, Age, and Course**.  
   - Provides options to **Edit** or **Delete** each student.

2. **Add Student**  
   - A form where you can add a new student by entering their **name, age, and course**.  
   - On submission, the student gets stored in the SQLite database.

3. **Edit Student**  
   - Allows updating student details.  
   - The form is pre-filled with the current student’s information.  
   - Updates are saved back to the database.

4. **Delete Student**  
   - Removes a student from the database permanently.  
   - A confirmation prompt ensures accidental deletions are avoided.
